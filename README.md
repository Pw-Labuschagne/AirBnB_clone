Let's go with the AirBnB task.(it is goint to be a hard one so hold on to your ones and zeros)

Description of the project:

This project will span over the next couple of months. It will be compiled on several different occasions to improve the design and usability of the project.
With this project we are set out to create a clone of the website AirBnB.
It will consist out of several different tasks aswell as components to create a real feel clone of the website. For the first part of our ABnB project we need a command line interpreter(CLI).

We are going to use the CLI for several commands and purposes but for now, it is used to modify database engines aswell as the file.json (the file storage engine).
We will be able to :
#-Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
#-Retrieve an object from a file, a database ect.
#-Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, ect)
#-Update attributes of an object
#-Destroy an object

(Oh what fun this is going to be....some hard fun)

The CLI would be used as such:

To start the CLI we use the command ./console.py
This is a executable file used to run the console (CLI) program.
Example:

$./console.py
(hbnb)
(hbnb)

Using the CLI:

There are several usages of the console (CLI), but the most common one touse would be the "help" command.
Typing this command will list the available commands to assist you to use the console.
It would look something like this:

(hbnb)help
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)quit
$

There will also be other commands avaiable such as create, show, destroy, all and update.
More on the use and examples of that later on.
